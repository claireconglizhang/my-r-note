# Why this repo?
So, one day I realized three things.   
I need to write down some code note so that they won't slip off my memory.  
I need them to live online so I can access them without my computer.  
I don't want to create a website because that requires me to make all the repo public. I mean, it's public now, otherwise you won't see it. But I'd like to keep my option of turning it to private anytime.  

While, here comes the MD files, the GitHub friendly document, the bridge from RMD to HTML/PDF/WORD.   
MD file is such a BRILLIANT solution.  
Wanna check these MDs out?  
Any comments, suggestions, and ideas about my notes are greatly appreciated! Simply fork this repo and let's communicate!
