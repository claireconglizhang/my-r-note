# Why this repo?

So, one day I realized three things. 

 * I need to write down some code notes so that they won't slip off my memory (a bunch of R cheatsheets exist for a reason).
 * I need them to live online so I can access them even on my cell phone without having to search my computer and pull out the rmd or r file.  
 * I don't want to create a website because that requires me to make the repo public. I mean, it's public now, otherwise you won't see it. But I'd like to know that I can turn it off to private anytime.  

While, here comes the MD files, the GitHub-friendly document, the bridge from RMD to HTML/PDF/WORD.   
MD file is a BRILLIANT solution.  
Wanna check these MDs out?  [Note 1, data management](./note1.md); [Note 2, website](./note2.md); [Note 3, Xaringan slides](./note3.md), [Note 4, causal inference](./note4.md). More to come.

Any comments, suggestions, and ideas on my code are greatly appreciated! Please simply fork this repo and let's communicate!
