# Why this repo?
So, one day I realized three things.   
I need to write down some code notes so that they won't slip off my memory.  
I need them to live online so I can access them even on my cell.  
I don't want to create a website because that requires me to make the repo public. I mean, it's public now, otherwise you won't see it. But I'd like to know that I can turn it off to private anytime.  

While, here comes the MD files, the GitHub-friendly document, the bridge from RMD to HTML/PDF/WORD.   
MD file is such a BRILLIANT solution.  
Wanna check these MDs out?  [Note 1, data management](./note1.md); [Note 2, website](./note2.md); [Note 3, Xaringan slides](./note3.md).

Also, any comments, suggestions, and ideas about my notes are greatly appreciated! Please simply fork this repo and let's communicate!
